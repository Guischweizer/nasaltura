So far we just have a simple dashboard layout structure.
So if you want start this project all you gonna need to do is:


**You gonna need a API KEY to make NASA Requests so, you can get one in this link:**
> https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#apply-for-an-api-key

After you have a API KEY, we need to place that one in our `globalconfig.jsx` file and change the value of the API_KEY.


**First:**
Clone the project with: 
> ´git clone https://github.com/Guischweizer/nasaltura.git´

The second step is get into the folder
> ´cd nasaltura´
 and run 
> ´npm install´

After all you need to do is run the project with 
>´npm start´ 
and access your 
>´localhost:3000´
